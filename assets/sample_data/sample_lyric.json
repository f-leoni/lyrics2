    "Lyric": "Play me \"Old King Cole\"\nthat I may join with you,\nall your hearts now seem so far from me\nit hardly seems to matter now.\n\nAnd the nurse will tell you lies\nof a Kingdom beyond the skies.\nBut I'm lost within this half-world,\nit hardly seems to matter now.\n\nPlay me my song,\nhere it comes again.\nPlay me my song,\nhere it comes again.\n\nJust a little bit,\njust a little bit more time,\ntime left to live out my life.\n\nPlay me my song,\nhere it comes again.\nPlay me my song,\nhere it comes again.\n\nOld King Cole was a merry old soul,\nand a merry old soul was he.\nSo he called for his pipe,\nand he called for his bowl,\nand he called for his fiddlers three.\n\nAnd the clock, tick tock,\non the mantlepiece,\nand I want,\nand I feel,\nand I know,\nand I touch the wall.\n\nShe's a lady, she's got time.\nBrush back you hair, and let me get to know your face.\nShe's a lady, she's mine.\nBrush back you hair, and let me get to know your flesh.\n\nI've been waiting here so long\nand all this time has passed me by.\nIt doesn't seem to matter now.\nYou stand there with your fixed expression\ncasting doubt on all I have to say.\nWhy don't you touch me, touch me?\nWhy don't you touch me, touch me?\nTouch me now, now now, now, now ...\n\nThe musical box:\nWhile Henry Hamilton-Smythe minor (8) was playing croquet with Cynthia Jane De Blaise-William (9), sweet smiling Cynthia\nraised her mallet high and gracefully removed Henry's head. Two weeks later, in Henry's nursery, she discovered his treasured\nmusical box. Eagerly she opened it and as \"Old King Cole\" began to play, a small spirit-figure appeared. Henry had returned -\nbut not for long, for as he stood in the room his body began ageing rapidly, leaving a child's mind inside. A lifetime's desires\nsurged through him. Unfortunately the attempt to persuade Cynthia Jane to fulfill his romantic desire led his nurse to the\nnursery to investigate the noise. Instinctively she hurled the musical box at the bearded child, destroying both."
